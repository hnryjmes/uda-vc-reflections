When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For working on another computer, or working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Greater control over which file is the version you want

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is when you want to work on your own version of an existing public
    project. A clone is when you copy the files from a project on GitHub to a
    local location. A branch is when you want to work on a different version of
    a local project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Helps manages conflicts

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    you could do pair programming, but that only works if you're in the same
    room! using GitHub allows collaboration with people worldwide.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    for a different version of the same project that isn't suitable to be
    merged with the master (yet)
